# FDM_InterlayerConnection

This project contains the development of a mechatronic system designed to address this
problem and improve interlayer adhesion for FDM printers. The system incorporates
four high optical power laser diodes, which are utilized to fuse the previous layer and
alloy it with the newly extruded material. By operating at a printing speed of 20 mm/s,
the system achieved a significant increase in interlayer adhesion of up to 25% when using
polylactic acid (PLA) filament.
The development of this system holds promising potential to greatly enhance the achiev-
able strengths of FDM printers, thereby opening up new application fields for parts that
require isotropic behavior.

Code in this repository is a parser, that uses CURA sliced gCode and computes the new
instructions for the lasers
